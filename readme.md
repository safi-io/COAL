# Computer Organization and Assembly Language

This repo contains all the lab work, assignments, and notes for the **Computer Organization and Assembly Language** course in my 4th semester.

I'm following **Dr. Nauman’s (Recluze)** playlist and trying to learn the core concepts of assembly programming. This is not a polished project – just a learning repo where I'm collecting my progress and code.

## Folder Structure

- `FINAL-LAB/` – Final terminal lab code and evaluation
- `MID-LAB/` – Mid exam lab files
- `LAB-CODE-ASSIGNMENTS/` – Weekly lab assignments
- `RECLUZE-PLAYLIST-CODE/` – Code from Dr. Nauman’s lectures

## Misc Files

Some DOS tools and test files used during the course:
- `AFD.EXE`, `nasm.exe`, `ndisasm.exe`, `TEST.OBJ` – Tools for running and debugging ASM code
- `rtn.asm` – Sample/assignment assembly code
